## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11** (specifically required - not 3.10 or 3.12)
  - Why 3.11? This version provides the optimal balance of performance and compatibility with our dependencies (DuckDB, GeoPandas, NumPy 2.x)
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** - Fast Python package manager and resolver
  - Installation: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)
- **OpenAI API Key** (or compatible LLM endpoint) for conversational interface

### Local Development

1. **Start the MCP bridge + MCP stdio server** (port 8010):

```bash
make serve
```

2. **In a second terminal, start the UI** (port 8501):

```bash
make ui
```

3. Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start both services:
- **server**: HTTP bridge (FastAPI) + true MCP stdio server on port 8010
- **ui**: Streamlit interface on port 8501

## Example Queries

Once the system is running, you can ask questions like:

**Simple Queries:**
- "What were the CO2 emissions from transport in Germany in 2023?"
- "Show me power industry emissions in California for 2022"
- "What are the transport emissions for Paris in 2020?"

**Temporal Analysis:**
- "How have transport emissions in the United States changed from 2000 to 2023?"
- "Compare monthly transport emissions in Beijing between 2022 and 2023"
- "What were the peak emissions months for power industry in Texas in 2023?"

**Comparative Queries:**
- "Compare transport emissions between France and Germany in 2023"
- "Which US state had the highest power industry emissions in 2022?"
- "Compare emissions from transport and power industry in China in 2023"

**Complex Multi-Sector:**
- "Analyze transport and power industry emissions trends in India from 2015 to 2023"
- "What sectors contribute most to emissions in California?"

**Smart Entity Resolution (NEW!):**
The system now intelligently handles various name formats and aliases:
- **Country aliases**: "USA", "US", "America" → "United States of America"
- **State abbreviations**: "CA", "TX", "NY" → "California", "Texas", "New York"
- **City nicknames**: "NYC" → "New York", "LA" → "Los Angeles"
- **Typo correction**: "Califronia" → "California" (fuzzy matching at 80%+ similarity)
- **Auto-level detection**: Automatically determines if you're querying a country, state, or city
- **Intelligent fallback**: If city data unavailable, tries state → country automatically

**Notes:**
- You can now use common aliases like "USA", "UK", "NYC" - the system normalizes them automatically!
- Emissions are in tonnes CO₂ (displayed as MtCO₂ for large values)
- Data covers 2000-2024 with monthly resolution
- Available sectors: transport, power-industry, waste, agriculture, buildings, fuel-exploitation, industrial-combustion, industrial-processes

## Architecture

### MCP Server Stack (`mcp_http_bridge.py` + `mcp_server_stdio.py`)

- `mcp_http_bridge.py`: FastAPI bridge that exposes the legacy HTTP REST surface (`/query`, `/list_files`, etc.) while proxying every request to the real MCP stdio server. Includes CORS security restrictions and configurable origin whitelisting.
- `mcp_server_stdio.py`: The fully featured MCP implementation that speaks the Model Context Protocol over stdio and executes all DuckDB queries. Features include:
  - **Smart Entity Resolution**: Normalizes location names, handles aliases, performs fuzzy matching, and auto-detects geographic levels
  - **Security**: Comprehensive SQL injection prevention with input validation, column name sanitization, and parameterized queries
  - **Performance**: Connection pooling, optimized query execution (no redundant queries), and efficient cursor management
  - **MCP Tools**: 15+ tools including `smart_query_emissions`, `query_emissions`, `calculate_yoy_change`, `get_file_info`, and more

The bridge automatically spawns `mcp_server_stdio.py` on startup and relays JSON-RPC traffic between HTTP clients (UI, automation) and the MCP server. This keeps existing HTTP integrations working while using the canonical MCP runtime under the hood.

### UI (`streamlit_app.py`)

Streamlit chat interface with:
- Multiple persona modes (Analyst, Technical, Policy Advisor)
- Chat-first layout with inline controls
- CSV export of query results
- Status indicators and error handling
- Secure credential management (no hardcoded defaults)

## API Reference

The HTTP bridge exposes the following RESTful endpoints on port 8010:

### Query Endpoint

}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure the system using environment variables. Create a `.env` file or export them in your shell:

#### MCP Server Configuration

```bash
# Required
export MCP_MANIFEST_PATH=data/curated-2/manifest_mcp_duckdb.json

# Optional
export PORT=8010                          # HTTP server port (default: 8010)
export MCP_RATE_CAP=60                    # Rate limit: requests per 5 minutes per IP
export MCP_LOG_LEVEL=INFO                 # Logging level: DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR
```

#### LLM Configuration

```bash
# Required for conversational interface
# IMPORTANT: Must be in "username:password" format for authentication
export OPENAI_API_KEY=username:password   # Your API credentials in username:password format

# Optional
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1  # LLM endpoint
export MODEL=gpt-4                        # Model name (gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.)
```

**Security Note:** The system no longer accepts hardcoded credentials. The `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is required and must be in `username:password` format. The application will fail fast with a clear error if credentials are missing or incorrectly formatted.

#### Query Behavior Defaults

```bash
# Assist Mode: how the LLM assists with query interpretation
export ASSIST_DEFAULT=smart               # smart|lite|off (default: smart)
  # smart: Full LLM-powered query understanding
  # lite: Basic query parsing
  # off: Direct SQL only

# Proxy Strategy: how to handle missing admin-1/city data
export PROXY_DEFAULT=spatial              # spatial|random|off (default: spatial)
  # spatial: Find nearby locations with data
  # random: Use random sampling
  # off: No proxy fallback

export PROXY_MAX_K=10                     # Max proxy results to return
export PROXY_RADIUS_KM=100                # Search radius for spatial proxy (km)
```

#### Streamlit UI Configuration

```bash
export STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=8501         # UI port (default: 8501)
export STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0   # Bind address
```

#### Security Configuration

```bash
# CORS Origins (comma-separated list of allowed origins)
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8501,http://localhost:3000

# Default allows localhost origins only for security
# Add your production domains as needed:
# export ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com

# Environment mode (affects error messages and security defaults)
export ENVIRONMENT=production              # production|development (default: production)

# Rate Limiting
export RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100        # Max requests per window (default: 100)
export RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS=60       # Rate limit window in seconds (default: 60)
```

**Security Best Practice:** Never use `*` for allowed origins in production. The system now enforces explicit origin whitelisting to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

#### Database Configuration

```bash
# Database file path
export DB_PATH=data/warehouse/climategpt.duckdb  # Path to DuckDB database

# Connection pool settings
export DB_POOL_SIZE=10                    # Connection pool size (default: 10)
export DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20              # Maximum concurrent connections (default: 20)

# Note: Higher pool sizes improve concurrent query performance but use more memory
# Recommended: 10-20 for most deployments, 20-50 for high-traffic production
```

#### Performance Configuration

```bash
# LLM Concurrency Control
export LLM_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=10           # Max concurrent LLM API calls (default: 10)
  # Lower values (2-5): Conservative, prevents rate limiting
  # Higher values (10-20): Better throughput if API allows

# Query Result Caching
export CACHE_SIZE=1000                    # Cache entry limit (default: 1000)
export CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=300              # Cache TTL in seconds (default: 300/5min)
```

#### Development & Debugging

```bash
export DEBUG=true                         # Enable debug mode
export LOG_QUERIES=true                   # Log all SQL queries
```

See `docker-compose.yml` for container-specific configuration examples.

## Testing

### Unit & Integration Tests

Run the test suite:

```bash
make test
```

Or with pytest directly:

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

### LLM Comparative Testing

The system has been tested with multiple LLM backends. Key findings:
- **Default LLM**: 100% success rate, 5.7s average response time (recommended for production)
- **Llama Q5_K_M**: 80% success rate, 10.4s average response time (viable for development/testing)
- All tool calls and natural language summarization working correctly

See `docs/TESTING_RESULTS.md` for detailed comparison results.

For automated LLM testing tools, see the `testing/` directory which includes:
- Test harness with 50 question bank covering all sectors and query types
- Analysis and visualization scripts
- LM Studio setup guides

## Data Sources

This project uses EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) v2024 datasets:
- CO₂ emissions by sector (transport, power industry, etc.)
- Global coverage with spatial resolution
- Monthly temporal resolution (2000-2024)

## Usage Notes

- Use exact country names (e.g., "United States of America" not "USA")
- All emissions values are in tonnes CO₂; large numbers displayed as MtCO₂
- No forecasts or per-capita metrics (by design)
- Queries are limited by rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start

**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError` or import errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure dependencies are installed
uv sync

# Or with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.11.x
```

**Problem:** Port 8010 already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 8010
lsof -ti:8010 | xargs kill -9

# Or change the port
export PORT=8011
make serve
```

#### UI Connection Issues

**Problem:** UI can't connect to MCP server

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify server is running
curl http://localhost:8010/health

# Check server logs for errors
# Make sure both server and UI are running in separate terminals

# Terminal 1
make serve

# Terminal 2
make ui
```

#### Database Errors

**Problem:** `DuckDB: IO Error: No such file or directory`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify database exists
ls -lh data/warehouse/climategpt.duckdb

# Check manifest path
export MCP_MANIFEST_PATH=data/curated-2/manifest_mcp_duckdb.json

# Verify manifest is valid
python -c "import json; print(json.load(open('data/curated-2/manifest_mcp_duckdb.json')))"
```

#### LLM/OpenAI Errors

**Problem:** `AuthenticationError` or `Invalid API key`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here

# Or create a .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
```

**Problem:** Rate limit errors from OpenAI

**Solution:**
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Switch to a different model with higher limits
- Consider using a local LLM (see `testing/LM_STUDIO_SETUP.md`)

#### Docker Issues

**Problem:** Docker build fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean Docker cache
docker system prune -a

# Rebuild with no cache
docker compose build --no-cache

# Check Docker resources (need at least 4GB RAM)
docker stats
```

**Problem:** Container exits immediately

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check container logs
docker compose logs server
docker compose logs ui

# Verify environment variables in docker-compose.yml
```

#### Query Returns No Results

**Problem:** Valid question returns empty data

**Possible causes:**
1. **Country name mismatch**: Use "United States of America" not "USA"
2. **Data not available**: Not all locations have city/admin-1 level data
3. **Time range**: Data is limited to 2000-2024
4. **Sector name**: Use exact sector names (e.g., "power-industry" not "power")

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check available datasets
curl http://localhost:8010/list_files

# Try a simpler query first
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What were transport emissions in Germany in 2023?"}'
```

#### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Slow query responses

**Solution:**
- Check system resources (CPU, RAM, disk I/O)
- Reduce `PROXY_MAX_K` for faster spatial queries
- Use yearly data instead of monthly for large time ranges
- Consider optimizing DuckDB with `PRAGMA threads=4`
