## Testing Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **ClimateGPT Running**
   ```bash
   # Ensure ClimateGPT server is running
   cd /Users/dharmpratapsingh/Downloads/DataSets_ClimateGPT
   make serve
   # Or manually:
   uv run python mcp_http_bridge.py
   ```

2. **LM Studio Setup (for Meta Llama)**
   - Download LM Studio: https://lmstudio.ai/
   - Install and launch LM Studio
   - Download a model (recommended):
     - Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (4.7GB)
     - Meta-Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct (lighter, 2GB)
   - Start local server:
     - In LM Studio: Click "Local Server" tab
     - Click "Start Server"
     - Default endpoint: http://localhost:1234/v1

3. **Test Question Bank**
   - JSON version: `test_question_bank.json`
   - CSV version: `test_question_bank.csv`

---

## Testing Methods

### Method 1: Manual Testing (Recommended for Initial Testing)

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Open both systems:**
   - ClimateGPT: http://localhost:8501 (Streamlit UI)
   - LM Studio: Chat interface

2. **For each question:**
   - Ask the same question to both systems
   - Copy responses to results spreadsheet
   - Rate each response (see Scoring section below)

3. **Record results in spreadsheet:**
   - Use template: `test_results_template.csv`

**Pros:**
- Better understanding of responses
- Can evaluate nuance and context
- Easy to start immediately

**Cons:**
- Time-consuming (50 questions × 2 systems)
- Manual data entry prone to errors

---

### Method 2: Automated Testing (Recommended for Full Testing)

**Step 1: Create test harness script**

```python
# test_harness.py
import json
import requests
import time
from datetime import datetime

# Load questions
with open('test_question_bank.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    questions = data['questions']

# Test ClimateGPT
def test_climategpt(question_text):
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            "http://localhost:8010/query",
            json={"question": question_text},
            timeout=30
        )
        elapsed = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
        return {
            "response": response.json(),
            "response_time_ms": elapsed,
            "status_code": response.status_code,
            "error": None
        }
    except Exception as e:
        elapsed = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
        return {
            "response": None,
            "response_time_ms": elapsed,
            "status_code": None,
            "error": str(e)
        }

# Test Llama via LM Studio
def test_llama(question_text):
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            "http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions",
            json={
                "model": "meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "role": "system",
                        "content": "You are an expert on climate emissions data. Provide accurate, concise answers with specific numbers when possible."
                    },
                    {
                        "role": "user",
                        "content": question_text
                    }
                ],
                "temperature": 0.1,  # Low temp for factual responses
                "max_tokens": 500
            },
            timeout=30
        )
        elapsed = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
        return {
            "response": response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'],
            "response_time_ms": elapsed,
            "status_code": response.status_code,
            "error": None
        }
    except Exception as e:
        elapsed = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
        return {
            "response": None,
            "response_time_ms": elapsed,
            "status_code": None,
            "error": str(e)
        }

# Run all tests
results = []
for i, q in enumerate(questions, 1):
    print(f"Testing question {i}/50: {q['question'][:50]}...")

    result = {
        "question_id": q['id'],
        "question": q['question'],
        "category": q['category'],
        "sector": q['sector'],
        "level": q['level'],
        "grain": q['grain'],
        "difficulty": q['difficulty'],
        "climategpt": test_climategpt(q['question']),
        "llama": test_llama(q['question']),
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }

    results.append(result)
    time.sleep(1)  # Rate limiting

# Save results
output_file = f"test_results_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.json"
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)

print(f"\nTesting complete! Results saved to: {output_file}")
```

**Step 2: Run the test harness**

```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
uv pip install requests

# Run tests
python test_harness.py
```

**Pros:**
- Fast execution (5-10 minutes for all 50 questions)
- Consistent testing methodology
- Automatic data collection
- Timestamped results

**Cons:**
- Requires both servers running
- Need to manually score accuracy afterward

- **4**: Accurate data with minor formatting issues
- **3**: Partially accurate (correct order of magnitude)
- **2**: Incorrect data but relevant attempt
- **1**: Completely wrong or hallucinated data
- **0**: No answer or error

#### 2. Completeness
- **5**: Answers all parts of question with context
- **4**: Answers main question with minor omissions
- **3**: Partial answer, missing some requested info
- **2**: Minimal answer, significant gaps
- **1**: Barely addresses the question
- **0**: No relevant information

#### 3. Response Quality
- **5**: Clear, well-formatted, professional
- **4**: Good quality with minor formatting issues
- **3**: Adequate but could be clearer
- **2**: Poorly formatted or confusing
- **1**: Very poor quality or unclear
- **0**: Unusable response

#### 4. Usefulness
- **5**: Immediately actionable, includes insights
- **4**: Useful with good context
- **3**: Adequate for basic needs
- **2**: Minimally useful
- **1**: Not useful
- **0**: Useless or misleading

## Analysis Plan

After collecting results, analyze:

### 1. Aggregate Metrics

```python
import json
import pandas as pd

# Load results
with open('test_results.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Convert to DataFrame for analysis
results_df = pd.DataFrame(data['results'])

# Calculate averages
metrics = ['accuracy', 'completeness', 'quality', 'usefulness']
for metric in metrics:
    climategpt_avg = results_df[f'climategpt_{metric}'].mean()
    llama_avg = results_df[f'llama_{metric}'].mean()
    print(f"{metric.capitalize()}:")
    print(f"  ClimateGPT: {climategpt_avg:.2f}")
    print(f"  Llama: {llama_avg:.2f}")
    print(f"  Difference: {climategpt_avg - llama_avg:.2f}\n")
```

### 2. Performance by Category

Compare performance across:
- Sectors
- Geographic levels
- Temporal grains
- Difficulty levels
- Question categories

### 3. Identify Weaknesses

Look for patterns where ClimateGPT underperforms:
- Specific question types
- Certain sectors
